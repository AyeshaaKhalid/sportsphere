Sports Sphere is an ASP.NET 7.0 application designed as an e-commerce platform for sports-related products. It comprises two class libraries: SportsSphere.DataModel and SportsSphere.DataAccessLayer, and two Blazor Server Apps: SportsSphere.Users and SportsSphere.Admin. The project utilizes .NET 7 and Microsoft SQL Server for the backend database.

## System Architecture
### Class Libraries
#### SportsSphere.DataModel
Contains model classes representing entities in the database (e.g., Product Category, Products, Cart Items, Users, Admins, Stock Refills).
#### SportsSphere.DataAccessLayer
Implements Data Access Layer (DAL) classes responsible for handling CRUD operations for the corresponding model classes.
### Blazor Server Apps

#### SportsSphere.Users

Responsibly handles user-facing functionalities.
Code is segregated into modules corresponding to distinct user operations (login, sign up, product browsing, cart management, order confirmation, and informational pages).
Comments provide clear explanations of functions, methods, and significant code segments.
#### SportsSphere.Admin

Manages administrative tasks.
Follows the principle of separation of concerns, ensuring different modules are dedicated to tasks like category management, product administration, user and admin management, and stock refill functionalities.
Comprehensive commenting throughout the codebase facilitates ease of understanding and maintenance.
